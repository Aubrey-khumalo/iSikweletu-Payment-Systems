<fieldset><legend><h4>Our Story</h4></legend>
<a name="ourStory"></a>
<p>During the corona pandemic people where restricted to public excess and lockdrown regulations where put in place as to prevent spread of corona virus. During these prevention methods many people that largely relied on contact exchage of money had to postpone there endevours. At the University of Zululand there are campus residences that are owned by community locals which students rent. During the national lockdown universities and schools where ordered by the president to close. This closure resulted in students returning home and not being able to pay their landlord the money due to her/him for the room which currently contains their belongings. <br><br>
People that were separated during the lockdown without having to be paid their money they can use iSikweletu and the number of the person that owes them to make a request for them to pay them back their money. This way you can be reminded to setle your debts if you had forgotten or just so you can concider prioritizing paying back the money you owe.
